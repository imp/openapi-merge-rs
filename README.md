### OpenAPI v3 merge library and command line tool

This project is inspired by the TypeScript [openapi-merge](https://github.com/robertmassaioli/openapi-merge) package and
implementation and configuration format are compatible with it (well, to a reasonable extent)

Supported OpenAPI specification version is v3.0.x
